
#HTML5 LAYOUT

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.ayout

#PROCESS & Design

* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.


#EXTRA MARKUP

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
